# Motivation

Several times in many applications we are working with entities likes Products, Users etc. Constantly we are writing same code over and over for example to find user inside array of users or trying to remove it from that array.

I come from Angular world and there is famous library called @ngrx. They implemented entity-adapter which helps with managing entities. I wanted the same to use in my projects in which I am not using @ngrx.

That is why I created this library - mostly for personal use but feel free to use it in your projects.

### Big thanks to @ngrx team

Thank you for bringing great library to manage entities. You did awesome job!
